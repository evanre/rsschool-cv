## Info
Hi, I'm a Front-End web developer with my primary strengths in great UI/UX, web standards, accessibility, SEO and mobile-first PWAs. I'm experienced with React and Vue.js frameworks and various smaller tools and libraries for modern front-end development.
I would consider opportunities where I could not only put my existing strengths to use, but additionally immerse myself into even more advanced areas of programming. I'm also interested in getting some hands-on exposure to back-end development, using Node.js (and MEAN stack) for engineering on the server side.
